Raspberry Pi Crate - A supercomputer using Raspberry Pis

The Raspberry Pi Crate is a collection of eight Raspberry Pis in a convenient form to allow students to practice multiprocessor processing. The Crate holds eight Pis in a trivial supercomputer format; networked through a Ethernet network switch to expand the teaching principle of Raspberry PI into multiprocessor supercomputing.

The Raspberry Pi Crate holds the eight Raspberry Pis, the network switch (a Netgear FS116) and a power unit (a Anker AH231) within a Perspex frame that fits snuggly into an A4 Paper ream box for easy storage and transport.

It should be noted that the PiCrate is intended for instructional purposes and is probably not suitable for production use . The PiCrate requires two power points and accepts an Ethernet (wired) connection to a wider network and has been optimised for headless use (but can be fitted with a keyboard and monitor if needed). The Pi cluster requires no fans and is suitable to sit on a desk beside each student as they learn cluster programming.

Included within the Git are photos of the Raspberry Pi Model B Crate, a Bill of Materials (what you need to make one yourself) and the CAD files required for both Model B and Model B+(coming soon) Crates. The CAD files were developed in FreeCAD an Open Source CAD program. The CAD files were then converted to .DXF format so please take care when passing the files to a laser cutter.

Assembly instructions are on the ‘to-do’ list.

I hope you will find this format useful, and I leave it to you to develop software and course material to teach parallel processing to the future innovators.
